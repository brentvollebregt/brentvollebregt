**Hi there 👋 Thanks for visiting my GitHub profile, it's great to see you!** 😀

Here are some quick things about me:

- 🔭 I'm a software developer from New Zealand and I love Python, TypeScript and React.
- 💻 I enjoy programming a lot.
- 📫 Depending on what you're wanting, the best way to reach me is:
    - Help on a post / video I made: Comment on the post / video
    - Anything else: Email me
- ⚡ I love using multiple cursors in vscode - it's a really useful feature and can get some large jobs done quickly.

You can also find me at ...

- 🌐 [nitratine.net](https://nitratine.net/): where I write small posts on how to do stuff I'll probably forget later or just want to show off.
- 🎥 [YouTube/PyTutorials](https://www.youtube.com/PyTutorials): where I make medium-level Python tutorials on focused topics.

Also, here is a [small portfolio of my faviourite projects](https://nitratine.net/portfolio/) 😎
